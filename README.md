# Camera-controllable-Robotic-Arm
It is an Arduino based robotic arm as of humanoid or prosthetic. The hand utilizes 5 servo motors, functioning each finger respectively. Using CV2 and Mediapipe from python script the code provides finger count which is sent to arduino via serial communication.

**Arduino connections:**

    2 > servo_pin-1
    3 > servo_pin-2
    4 > servo_pin-3
    5 > servo_pin-4
    6 > servo_pin-5
